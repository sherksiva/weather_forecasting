                <p>Welcome to the weather forecast. Now, let’s see what the weather is like today. In the north of the country, it’s very windy and cold. There is a chance of some rain too, so don’t leave home without your umbrella! The temperature is around 10º centigrade. In the east it’s rainy all day today, I’m afraid. There may be a thunderstorm in the afternoon. The temperature is a bit higher, at around 13º.</p>
